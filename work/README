                            Console for MarkLogic



   1. Installation

     Create a new HTTP server in the MarkLogic admin Console.  Copy the
   content of the src/ directory to the root of the App Server (depending on
   the options you selected creating the App Server, it could be on its
   modules database, or on the filesystem if you decided to store the modules
   of this App Server on the filesystem).  The database linked to the HTTP
   server will be used only to store the Console configuration document.  You
   can then access the Console by pointing your preferred browser to (say the
   port has been set to 8888):

       http://localhost:8888/home.xq

     The help page is:

       http://localhost:8888/help.xq
